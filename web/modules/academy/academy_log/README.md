# Academy Log module

## Summary

At the moment the `academy_log` module is a very slim implementation to track progress of users participating in the academy distributed by the `progress` module. It only provides an overview page defined in `OverviewController`.

## Todos

- Use services from progress module to calculate statistics.
- Introduce averaging statistics, when there is more trackable traffic.
- Extend statistics for individual user, e.g. document answers to questions or workshop participation.
